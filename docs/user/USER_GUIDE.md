# User Guide

Glavred currently provides a local-first editorial cabinet with author memory and a
working production flow.

The app starts with `Память автора`: loose thoughts, link reactions, and manual
corrections that become evidence-backed assertions about the author's position. From
there, the user can still move through the production flow from source signal to
insight card, content plan item, approved post brief, deterministic draft, editorial
checks, approved text, visual decision, ready state, and captured editorial learning
notes. The current manual release package is compatibility behavior until the future
publication log replaces it.

Work is saved in browser local storage. Save/status messages appear only after an
explicit action and disappear automatically; the app does not keep a permanent bottom
toast over the workspace.

For a visual walkthrough with real interface screenshots, use the GitHub Wiki after it
has been initialized:

## Visual Wiki

The wiki explains the current product through real screenshots:

- `Память автора`: quick thoughts, links, files, targeted corrections, evidence, and
  confidence.
- Production flow: `Сигналы -> Кандидаты постов -> Инсайт -> План -> Фабула поста`.
- Release and analytics: ready posts, future publication log, manual export
  compatibility, and captured learning note.
- Local-first demo: reset, persistence, and screenshot refresh commands.

Planning note: the current `План` screen is a local-first broadcast grid prototype
with explicit `Настройка сетки`. Settings define period, tempo, publishing days/times,
candidate limits, default platform, signal policy, and publication-size profiles. The
grid is still not the final calendar model: it creates publish-window slots and fills
them with deterministic topic/fabula ideas from the approved signal/candidate layer.
Publication size is not a candidate field: the slot/profile defines platform-kind
length, while the selected fabula only contributes a compact/standard/deep scale.

Production note: approved plan slots now enter an editorial work queue immediately.
`План` decides what should be produced and when; approving a slot creates the
`EditorialWorkItem` and its initial post fabula/brief. `Редактура` has `Посты` and
`Рабочий стол` tabs: the first tab lists approved posts with the shared
filter/search/group pattern, and the second edits one selected post through
`Фабула -> Драфт -> Визуал -> готов к выпуску`. `Финал` remains only a compatibility
artifact; it is not a user-facing tab. `Выпуск` is the future
publication log for delivery attempts, platform statuses, external links, and errors;
it should not edit text or visual content.

After Slice 1.8.2, `План` uses the same cabinet-list UX as the review queues: filters
and search appear above the slot list, `Список / Группы / Календарь` switches the view,
and every slot expands inside the main content area. The calendar view follows the same
week/month/quarter period as `Настройка сетки`, marks publish dates, shows how many
filtered candidates sit on each date, and opens the same slot cards below the clicked
date. Expanded and edit states show the source signal, topic, fabula, audience, value,
and goal so you know which candidate context is being scheduled. `Настройка сетки`
uses a mini-calendar: choose week/month/quarter, click dates to assign or remove
publish slots, then save explicitly before rebuilding the grid.

## Demo Context

The permanent demo is a Telegram blog by an AI Product Manager who shares research
experience building AI-B2B products.

The seeded notes cover:

- workflow risk instead of model choice;
- evals as a product function;
- demo magic failing after pilot;
- manual correction from support automation to GTM/adoption;
- enterprise trust through evidence and rollback;
- confidence boundaries from customer interviews.

## External Sources Local Shell

External source import is now available as a local-first UI shell inside
`Память автора`. It uses demo sources and mock candidates only. No Telegram API,
OAuth, crawler, backend, scheduled ingestion, or AI analysis is connected.

The UX keeps source review inside `Память автора` and separates it from the current
manual note feed through internal tabs:

- `Источники`: configure places where the author already leaves thoughts, such as a
  Telegram channel, social profile, blog/site, article archive, document, or manual
  upload.
- `Очередь разбора`: review imported candidates before they become memory or archive
  records.
- `Архив`: keep accepted historical posts and long-form materials with source
  provenance.

The `Источники` tab uses the same operational catalog pattern as topics and fabulas:
one source per row, key metadata visible immediately, row actions attached to the
source, and full notes/details after expanding the row.

For large archives, the planned queue supports group work:

- select one item, a page, or all items matching the active filter;
- clear the current selection from the same toolbar when the selected set is no longer
  needed;
- group by source, date, tag, duplicate cluster, or evidence risk;
- use `Добавить все` with a confirmation summary;
- accept many items into archive without reading every post;
- undo the latest bulk action when available.

Unreviewed imported material will not change `Как система поняла автора`. Bulk-added
archive material will also stay distinguishable from manually reviewed evidence.

## Editorial Model

`Редакционная модель` is the setup workspace for the virtual publishing project. It uses the same tab pattern as `Память автора` and has four internal tabs:

- `Издательство`: project profile plus structured rule blocks for author, audience, position, style, goals, and forbidden topics.
- `Темы`: compact one-row-per-topic list. Use `+ Тема` to create a draft row, then `Сохранить` to commit it. Expand a row to see details; use `Редактировать`, `Сохранить`, and `Отменить` to commit changes.
- `Фабулы`: the same compact list/detail/edit pattern for post dramaturgy entities, with `+ Фабула` for new dramaturgy patterns.
- `Матрица`: topic-fabula compatibility table. Checkbox changes stay in draft state until `Сохранить матрицу`; `Отменить` rolls the draft back.

Every tab has a right-side validation panel, but it does not validate live while you are still filling the setup. Click `Проверить` when you want a review. The panel stores the latest validation snapshot and switches to `Требует повторной проверки` after you save changed rules, topics, fabulas, project profile, or matrix links. In the current slice the check is deterministic: it reviews project profile, atomic rule coverage, style/anti-AI rules, topic/fabula compatibility, and goal readiness. Later validator slices will replace this scaffold with richer evidence and scores.

Deleting a topic or fabula removes it and all of its matrix links from the local workspace. Use `Пауза` when the entity should stay in the model but temporarily stop participating in planning. If a topic or fabula is already referenced by current production artifacts, Glavred warns before deletion; existing artifacts are not rewritten automatically in this slice.

Slice 1.2 turns the manual setup check into validator cards. The current validators
cover author-position clarity, anti-AI style coverage, audience value fit, goal
consistency, and topic/fabula coverage. Each card shows score, red/yellow/green
status, evidence, and suggested fixes.

## Signals

`Сигналы` replaces the old single `Радар` screen. It is the first review layer between
raw material and production.

The section has three internal tabs:

- `Радары`: demo radar definitions for author memory, archive, external sources, and
  manual research. Each row shows source type, acceptance policy, trigger mode, status,
  last run, and notes.
- `Найденные сигналы`: reviewable raw signals with filters by radar, status, search
  text, and duplicate risk. Expand a signal to see radar provenance, date, finding,
  evidence, duplicate search note, author correction, and actions.
- `Кандидаты постов`: deterministic post concepts assembled from approved signals,
  active topics/fabulas, audience, value, goal, and platform. Approve one
  candidate before building the insight when you want the candidate concept to drive the
  next step.

Available signal actions:

- `Утвердить сигнал`: marks the signal approved and makes it the current source signal
  for `Собрать инсайт`.
- `Редактировать`: lets you correct title, topic, fabula, value, and author
  correction through save/cancel UX.
- `В архив`: keeps the signal as non-active material.
- `Отклонить`: marks the signal rejected.

Manual corrections create author-memory input, so signal review also teaches the system
about the author's choices. Unapproved signals do not create post concepts.

### Signals correction after Slice 1.5.1

`Радары` are now editable search procedures.

Use this tab to:

- add a radar with `+ Радар`;
- edit its title, acceptance policy, trigger mode, rules, and sources;
- add one rule per search instruction;
- use `NOT` when a condition should exclude material;
- add several sources, or leave sources empty if the rules are enough for a future AI
  search layer;
- start, pause, or delete a radar.

`Найденные сигналы` now shows raw material only. A signal is not a post candidate yet.
It does not ask you to choose a topic or fabula. Review the radar, date, finding,
evidence, duplicate risk, and search note, then approve, archive, reject, or correct
the signal.

Approved signals become available in `Кандидаты постов`. The current implementation
shows 2-3 deterministic concepts and lets you filter by signal/status/topic/risk,
search by title/thesis/value/evidence, switch between list and grouped views, edit a
candidate inline, reject it, or approve it. Candidate edit shows the readonly source
signal and suggested topic, and lets you change the fabula. Candidate `format` is not
editable because the fabula already describes the editorial shape; plan formats belong
to the broadcast grid. Only an approved candidate can drive `Собрать инсайт`; rejected
or draft candidates stay out of the production flow.

### Signals UI after Slice 1.5.2

`Радары` and `Найденные сигналы` use framed rows. The row border shows which metadata,
details, evidence, and actions belong to the same entity. Expand one row at a time to
inspect details without losing the surrounding list context.

Status and duplicate-risk chips stay compact; if a row looks visually broken, treat it
as a UI regression rather than expected behavior.

Slice 1.5.3 adds the explicit `Сигналы` section header above the tabs and tightens the
layout: radar rows show source, title, status, signal count, and last run as one entity;
found-signal rows keep radar, title, date, duplicate risk, and review status readable.
Expanded details and edit forms stay inside the same card, and actions sit in a
separated footer.

Slice 1.5.4 aligns this header with `Редакционная модель`: the section title, purpose,
and stat cards use the same cabinet pattern. The `Найденные сигналы` tab counter is a
separate red badge, and the radar editor keeps base fields, rule groups, source groups,
and footer actions on one consistent form rhythm.

### Signals design-system consolidation after Slice 1.5.5

Ordinary create actions such as `+ Radar`, `+ Topic`, and `+ Fabula` use white
secondary buttons. Red primary buttons are reserved for validation, approval,
save/commit, and HITL lifecycle steps.

The radar toolbar follows the same compact count-left/action-right pattern as topics
and fabulas. Radar rows keep stable metadata slots for status, signal count, and last
run. Newly added radars show a visible fallback instead of leaving the last-run slot
empty.

### Signals layout stability after Slice 1.5.6

Opening or closing a radar should not move the Signals workspace sideways. The section
header stat cards stay pinned to the right edge of the header, and the radar editor
keeps visible spacing between labels and controls. These are now covered by
`npm run test:design`, so layout drift should be treated as a regression.

### Radar editing after Slice 1.5.7

Existing radars are edited in place. Click `Редактировать` on a radar card and the edit
form opens inside that same card, so you do not need to scroll to a duplicated form at
the top of the list.

Radar search rules and source values use multiline fields. Use them for full search
instructions, URLs, API/MCP notes, keyword sets, or source descriptions. A new radar can
still be created from the toolbar as a temporary draft form above the list.

### Radar filters after Slice 1.5.8

Radar setup now has four working blocks:

- trigger rules: what should count as a found signal;
- search sources: where the radar must search;
- source discovery mode: search only specified sources, specified plus additional
  sources, or autonomous discovery;
- editorial filters: author, audience, positioning, goals, forbidden topics, and
  topics.

Use `Фильтры отбора` to explain why material should pass, warn, be filtered out, or
intentionally create tension with the author's position. Style is not a radar filter;
style is checked later in drafting and editorial review.

If `Только указанные` is selected without at least one source, the radar editor shows a
warning and blocks save. Filtered-out signals remain visible in `Найденные сигналы` so
the author can review or override the decision.

## Context Chat

Use the `Помощник` button in the topbar to open the context chat. It is closed by
default and has no floating page button, so it does not cover working forms or lists.
When expanded, it opens as an overlay drawer from the right edge of the app; on narrow
screens it behaves like a bottom sheet. Use the `x` button to close it.

The assistant is synchronized with the current sidebar section and with internal tabs in
`Память автора` and `Редакционная модель`. It has two modes:

- `Чат`: ask a question about the current section or request a safe draft, for example
  “сгенерируй темы согласно настройкам издательства”.
- `Подсказки`: review deterministic recommendations for the current section. The tab
  shows a count, suggestions scroll inside the assistant, and read-only suggestions can
  be dismissed with `x`.

In this slice the assistant is deterministic: it reads the current workspace and latest
validator run, then suggests safe next steps. It does not call an AI provider.

Accepted suggestions do not save changes automatically. For example, `Создать черновик
темы`, `Создать черновик фабулы`, and `Добавить правило` only open the existing draft
form with prefilled fields. The author still reviews, edits, and clicks `Сохранить`.

## Current Supported Flow

- Open `Память автора`.
- Review seeded notes and the `Как система поняла автора` panel.
- Add a thought without a title, or reveal `+ Заголовок` if a title helps.
- Add a small local file through `+ Файл` when a thought or link reaction needs
  supporting material. Files are limited to 1 MB in the local demo.
- Remove an attached file before saving, or remove/replace it while editing a note.
- Add a link reaction and check the local preview before saving.
- Use search and type filters above the feed when the memory grows.
- Expand long notes with `Показать полностью` and collapse them back with `Свернуть`.
- Edit or delete notes from the card actions; evidence-backed notes ask for
  confirmation before deletion.
- Use `Корректировать` on an inferred assertion or evidence item to create a targeted
  manual correction.
- If a correction contradicts current evidence, choose `Смержить`, `Заменить вывод`,
  or `Откатить корректировку`.
- Use `Голосом` when the browser supports speech recognition; otherwise the button
  stays disabled and the text area remains the fallback.
- Review evidence behind author-position assertions.
- Open the internal `Источники` tab to inspect the demo source list for the AI Product
  Manager scenario.
- Open `Очередь разбора`, filter candidates by source/status/evidence policy/duplicate
  risk, and switch between `Список` and `Группы`.
- Use `В память` for one reviewed candidate when it should become active author
  memory. Use `В архив`, `Отклонить`, or `Не evidence` for non-active material.
- Use `Выбрать все по фильтру` and `Добавить все` for large archive-safe batches.
  Confirm the summary before applying the bulk action.
- After a page or filter selection, use `Сбросить выделение` or the switched
  `Снять выделение...` action to clear selected candidates.
- Queue statuses `Принятые из очереди` and `Bulk archive из очереди` show candidates
  that were processed from the queue. The separate `Архив` tab also includes seeded
  historical archive records that never existed as queue candidates.
- Open `Архив` to see accepted archive records with provenance. From an archive card
  you can add a record into active memory, return it to the review queue, mark it
  `Не evidence`, open the original source, or delete it from the local archive.
- Use `Отменить последнее групповое действие` when the latest bulk decision should be
  reverted.
- Open `Редакционная модель`, review the project profile in `Издательство`, add or edit one structured rule, and check the right-side validation panel.
- Open `Темы` and `Фабулы`, expand one row, use `Редактировать`, then `Сохранить` or `Отменить`. In `Фабулы`, `Масштаб` sets compact/standard/deep dramaturgical size intent without binding the fabula to a platform.
- Open `Матрица`, toggle one compatibility checkbox, then use `Сохранить матрицу` or `Отменить`.
- Open `Сигналы`.
- Inspect `Радары`, then open `Найденные сигналы`.
- Approve, archive, reject, or edit one signal. Approved signal becomes the current
  raw material for post candidates.
- Open `Кандидаты постов`, use filters/search/grouping, optionally edit or reject a
  candidate, and approve one candidate.
- Generate an insight card from the approved candidate.
- Add the insight to `План`.
- Open `Настройка сетки` when the publishing frame needs to change. Save settings
  explicitly; saved changes clear the current grid and downstream production artifacts
  so the plan can be rebuilt.
- In `Размер публикации`, choose the default publication profile and edit platform,
  publication kind, and min/target/max character range. These demo defaults are
  editable planning assumptions, not hard-coded official platform guarantees.
- Review the broadcast grid: each slot has date, time, platform, topic, fabula,
  priority, status, and advisory warnings. The side summary separates available
  candidates from approved concepts and shows deficit/proficit.
- Slice 1.8.1 note: filters/search sit above the broadcast list, and
  `Настройка сетки` uses a mini-calendar. Choose week/month/quarter, click dates to
  assign or remove publish slots, and save explicitly before rebuilding.
- Slice 1.8.2 note: use the `Календарь` view in the same filter toolbar to see
  candidate counts by date. Click a date to inspect the same broadcast slot cards for
  that day.
- Slot detail note: expanded and edit states show signal, topic, fabula, audience,
  value, goal, thesis, evidence, and risks so plan edits do not hide candidate context.
- Expand a slot, edit it if needed, then use `Сохранить` or `Отменить`.
- Approve one slot through the first HITL gate. Glavred creates the editorial work item
  and initial `Фабула` automatically.
- Open `Редактура`.
- In `Посты`, expand a queued post and use `К рабочему столу`, or open `Рабочий стол`
  and choose a post from the searchable picker.
- Review, edit if needed, and approve the prepared post brief through the second HITL
  gate. Glavred starts a backend `DraftRun`, shows queued/running progress in
  `Драфт`, then applies the completed draft to the selected post. During long runs the
  same block shows the current operation, for example a public search, candidate
  generation, LLM validation, ranking, or directed revision. There is no separate
  `Написать драфт` action.
- The run is created with a read-only context snapshot of the selected post: plan
  slot, candidate when available, source signal, topic, fabula, publisher rules, and
  author-position evidence. This appears in backend trace/debug, not as a new UI
  screen.
- The drafting backend is being expanded as an artifact pipeline, not a single larger
  prompt. The draft trace now includes a `SourceLedger` with claim provenance,
  allowed use, risks, and forbidden inferences. The runner then checks feasibility and
  locks a `PostContract` before writing. If the post is too weakly sourced, `Драфт`
  shows "Пост остановлен до генерации" with the reason and trace link instead of
  inventing a weak draft. If only the candidate link is missing but source signal,
  brief evidence, topic, and fabula are present, Glavred proceeds with constraints
  instead of stopping the run. Source intent, research plan, rule registry, and
  rhetorical plans are already visible in `/ai-runs`. Public evidence now reads
  exact URLs and, when backend OpenRouter web tools are enabled, executes public
  search tasks through `openrouter:web_search`; otherwise search tasks stay
  `notConfigured` in trace. The trace also shows the built search query and rejected
  citations when a provider result drifts away from the research task. Accepted public
   evidence is then synthesized and merged into an enriched SourceLedger before
    feasibility, post contract, rule registry, planning, and draft candidates. After the
    rule registry, Glavred also builds `EvidenceInterpretation`: what each accepted
    source changes in the argument, which examples are usable, where the evidence is
    weak, and which overclaims are forbidden. This helps sources shape the thought
    instead of appearing as forced name-drops. Planned,
  failed, disabled, or rejected source attempts stay as warnings and are not treated
  as proof. Draft candidate
  selection also has a publishability guard: emergency deterministic fallback drafts
  stay visible in trace, but they are excluded or penalized when a publishable provider
  candidate exists. If every candidate is invalid, `Драфт` shows a quality-blocked
  state with the DraftRun ID and trace link instead of silently showing a placeholder
  draft. The next backend quality layers are validators, ranking, directed revision,
  and regression. The rule registry is already visible in `/ai-runs` as stable rule ids,
  severity, criteria, and validator bindings. The PostContract also contains
  `publicationSizeContract` with target length range, hard max, paragraph/section
  range, density, and fabula scale. The main editor will keep
  showing compact status and warnings; full trace details stay in `/ai-runs`.
- Research defaults are configured in `Редакционная модель -> Фабулы` as
  `Исследовательская стратегия`. `Автоопределение` lets Glavred create human-readable
  research instructions from the post context; `Задать вручную` copies the fabula's
  instructions into new work briefs.
- In `Редактура -> Рабочий стол -> Фабула`, the same field is shown as
  `Источники и исследовательские поручения`. It is the final per-post override and
  accepts URLs, source names, and plain instructions such as "нужно мнение лидеров
  мнений по этой теме", plus prefixes like `url:`, `найти:`, `проверить:`, and
  `не использовать:`. DraftRuns normalize those approved lines into source intent,
  build a research plan, read exact URLs, and either execute OpenRouter web search or
  show disabled search tasks as `notConfigured`. Accepted public evidence is merged
  into the DraftRun SourceLedger before the post is evaluated and written.
- The trace also shows whether `MaterialPlan` selected enriched evidence, rejected it
  with reasons, retried with a primary/backup model, or used emergency fallback.
- The trace also shows model roles for child AI calls. Source planning and evidence
  synthesis use `research`, material/strategy/rhetorical planning use `strategy`,
  candidate writing and directed revisions use `writer`, and validation/ranking use
  `review`. Backup is still only a technical retry, not a creative second opinion.
- The revision loop is now editorial, not only mechanical. In `/ai-runs?runId=...`,
  each revision cycle shows which goals it tried to improve: idea strength, tension,
  reader value, author stance, source integration, structure, or validator health.
  The same trace shows old-vs-new dimension scores, accepted/rejected decision,
  rejected moves, and the stop reason. The main editor still receives one final draft.
- The trace now also shows `ArticleDossier` and `ContextPacks`. The dossier is local
  memory for one DraftRun: accepted evidence, usable claims, locked decisions, risks,
  rejected moves, and open questions as compact cards. Context packs show which of
  those cards were passed to strategy, writer, review, critic, and another-angle
  roles. This is debug/trace data, not a new main editor screen.
- The trace now includes a `validation` report for every draft candidate. It shows
  size/shape issues, missing CTA or contract signals, missing attribution, rejected
  evidence used as proof, forbidden moves, raw artifact leakage, and publishability
  consistency.
- The same `validation` trace can also include `LLM validation`: report-only model
  feedback for source grounding, publisher/author fit, topic/fabula fit,
  coherence/compression, and audience value. Actionable LLM issues are shown
  separately from positive observations, so pass notes do not inflate warning counts.
- The same trace can include `Editorial critique`: the prosecutor/editor critic looks
  at whether candidates are boring, generic, over-sourced, missing author stance,
  weak on tension, or unclear for the reader. The trace can then show `Alternative
  angle tournament`: Glavred asks another model role for one different route based on
  the critique and asks the writer to draft one challenger. Final validation and
  ranking compare the original candidates with that challenger.
- After validation, Glavred pairwise-ranks candidates and runs a bounded revision
  loop. Each cycle tries to repair concrete findings, validates the revised candidate,
  compares it with the previous best, and accepts it only if it improves measurable
  goals without regression. The main `Драфт` screen still shows one editable result,
  while `/ai-runs?runId=...` shows revision cycles, accepted/rejected attempts,
  resolved/unresolved goals, final source, and stop reason.
  If a late provider operation fails after Glavred already has a usable best draft,
  the trace shows that nested operation as failed and keeps the previous best instead
  of leaving generation stuck forever.
  - The main editor still receives one draft to edit. Alternative routes and the
    reason they won or lost stay in `/ai-runs?runId=...`.
- Review the four checks: `Стиль`, `Анти-AI`, `Фактчек`, and `Политика`.
- Read editor notes, edit the draft manually, and approve the text from `Драфт`.
- After text approval, open `Визуал`. Choose `Сгенерировать`, `Найти мем`,
  `Мем + генерация`, or `Без визуала`. The first three modes use one `Бриф`
  field; `Без визуала` has no extra field. `Сгенерировать` and `Найти мем` prepare
  deterministic variants directly from the brief. `Мем + генерация` first prepares
  meme references, then after `Выбрать мем` prepares custom remix variants from that
  reference. Approve only the selected final variant.
  A post becomes ready for release only after text approval and visual approval or
  `без визуала`.
- Open `Выпуск` to inspect delivery state. Until platform integrations exist, this
  section may still expose the compatibility manual export surface; the target model
  is a publication log, not a text or visual editor.
- Open `Аналитика`.
- Click `Подготовить аналитику`.
- Enter manual metrics and editorial conclusions.
- Click `Зафиксировать выводы`.
- Reload the page and confirm local workspace state persists.
- Reset the demo scenario from the topbar.

### Editing Fabula In The Workbench

`Редактура -> Рабочий стол -> Фабула` shows the read-only context of the selected
approved post: source signal, topic, fabula, audience, value, goal, platform,
publication date/time, confidence, candidate evidence, and risks. These fields identify
the candidate and slot; edit them in `Сигналы` or `План`, not inside the workbench.

The editable artifact on this screen is the `PostBrief`: title, thesis, conflict,
author position, audience, evidence, examples, structure, CTA, risks, and sources. If
you edit an already approved fabula, Glavred clears stale draft, checks, final text,
release, and learning artifacts and returns the post to `Фабула` until you approve the
updated brief again.

## Not Yet Supported
